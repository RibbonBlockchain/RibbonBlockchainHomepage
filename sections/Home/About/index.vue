            <h3>Revolutionizing healthcare incentives with blockchain</h3>
            <p>
              Ribbon Blockchain is a healthcare incentives platform that aims to modify behaviour through
              rewardable tasks. Ribbon channels donated, pledged or sponsored funding to health and
              wellness related behavioral incentives.
              <br />
              <br />Funding is sent directly to patients, community health workers and healthcare practitioners;
              where the funding is used for preventative care, adherence to medication and therapy,
              quality of care delivery and overall population health outcomes.
              <br />
              <br />Our Incentives are distributed in DAI which is a US Dollar stable coin to allow for a more
              stable source of income in countries with volatile currencies such as Zimbabwe or Venezuela.
